# About

Raymond Berger is an urbanist based in San Francisco, dedicated to reimagining streets and public spaces to foster connection and community.

Currently, Raymond is the Head of Publishing and Community at [The Lab of Thought](https://thelabofthought.co), where he is co-creating and publishing books on mobility. He is also the co-founder of [Urbanism Now](https://urbanismnow.com). Raymond bridges his technical expertise with urbanist practice on issues of mobility, public space, and the built environment.

Raymond holds a B.S. in Computer Science and Business Management from [Eckerd College](https://eckerd.edu) and an M.S. in Urban Studies from the [4CITIES](https://4cities.eu) program (in Brussels, Vienna, Amsterdam, and Oviedo).

The social and political upheavals of 2020-2021 solidified his belief that although technology is a powerful tool, our socio-political challenges ultimately cannot be resolved through technological solutions alone. This realization prompted a pivot from software engineering to urbanism.

Previously, he completed the [hackNY](https://hackny.org) fellowship in New York City (where he interned at BuzzFeed), and joined The New York Times as a software engineer, working at the intersection of site reliability engineering and machine learning to power large-scale recommendation systems. He also worked at the fertility-tech startup [OOVA](https://oova.life) and at [Maven](https://maven.com), an ed-tech startup focused on cohort-based courses. 

Since 2021, Raymond has served as a volunteer maintainer with the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org)'s [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org), steadily improving the experience for librarians, volunteers, and readers alike.
